            <p>"A champion for justice, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., helped awaken our Nation's
               long-slumbering
               conscience and inspired a generation. Through a cacophony of division and hatred, his voice rang out,
               challenging America to make freedom a reality for all of God's children and prophesying a day when the
               discord
               of our Union would be transformed into a symphony of brotherhood. His clarion call echoed the promise of
               our
               founding -- that each of us are created equal -- and every day he worked to give meaning to this timeless
               creed."</p>
